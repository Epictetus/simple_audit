# simple_audit

Simple auditing solution for ActiveRecord models. Provides an easy way of creating audit logs for complex model associations.
Instead of storing audits for all data aggregated by the audited model, you can specify a serializable representation of the model.
    
  * a helper method is provided to easily display the audit log
  * the Audit object provides a #delta method which computs the differences between two audits

In a nutshell:

    class Booking < ActiveRecord::Base
      simple_audit
      
      # data to be audited
      def audit_changes
        {
            :price => self.price,
            :period => self.period, 
            ...
        }
      end
    end
    
    # in your view
    <%= render_audits(@booking) %>

# Why ?

simple_audit is intended as a straightforward auditing solution for complex model associations. 
In a normalized data structure (which is usually the case when using SQL), a core business model will aggregate data from several associated entities.
More often than not in such cases, only the core model is of interest from an auditing point of view. 

So instead of auditing every entity sepparately, with simple_audit you decide for each audited model what data needs to be audited. 
This data will be serialized on every model update and the available helper methods will render a clear audit trail.

# Installation & Configuration

## As a gem
    
    gem install simple_audit

and require it
    
    config.gem 'simple_audit'

## As a plugin
  
    ./script/plugin install http://github.com/gtarnovan/simple_audit

## Database

Generate and run migration

    ./script/generate simple_audit_migration create_audits
    rake db:migrate    

# Usage

Audit ActiveRecord models. Somewhere in your (backend) views show the audit logs.
    
    # in your model
    # app/models/booking.rb
    
    class Booking < ActiveRecord::Base
        simple_audit
        ...
    end
    
    # in your view
    # app/views/bookings/booking.html.erb
    
    ...
    <%= render_audits(@booking) %>
    ...     

# Assumptions and limitations

  * Your user model is called User and the current user User.current
    See [sentient_user](http://github.com/bokmann/sentient_user) for more information.

  * You have to write your own tests (fow now)
  

    
## Customize auditing

By default after each save, all model's attributes are saved in the audits table.
You can customize the data which is saved by overriding the audit_changes method. All relevant data for the audited model should be included here.

    # app/models/booking.rb
    
    class Booking < ActiveRecord::Base
        simple_audit
    
        def audit_changes
          {
            :state  => self.state, 
            :price  => self.price.format,
            :period => self.period.to_s,
            :housing_units => housing_units.collect(&:name).join('; '),
            ...
            }
        end
        ...
    end
    
You can also customize the attribute of the User model which will be stored in the audit.

    # default is :name
    simple_audit :username_method => :email
    
## Rendering audit 

A helper method for displaying a list of audits is provided. It will render a decorated list of the provided audits;
only the differences between revisions will be shown, thus making the audit information easily readable.
